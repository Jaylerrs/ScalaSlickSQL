# ScalaSlickSQL
This is a sample only doing about how to connect My SQL database using Slick on Scala.
The sample is only get and insert database without any of database Join.
This's the most easy to get database just like only "Select * from Users where User.email = xxxx and User.password = xxxx" if existing just sign in else display some message
The sample isn't include of any security and checking input we just define the user is never fail on this case.
